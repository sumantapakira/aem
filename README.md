This plug-in helps content authors to tag content automatically based on the content. This plugin is
intelligent enough to detect language entered by authors and analyze the content by using Apache
Natural Language processing tool. This is a powerful feature for content authors to structure content
based on the auto created tags. Content authors do not need to tag pages manually.
This plugin uses the machine learning algorithm to detect 3 different entities:

* Person
* Location
* Organization

So, once an author create content then this plugin will analyze and extract the content based on the
above 3 criteria.
After text analyzation is complete, then this plugin will create SPARQL query to get the recognized
entities from DBPedia which is again based on Semantics web technology.
After extracting the entities, this plugin will auto create tags and associate those tags to the newly
created page. This also create links to Wikipedia for the recognized entities. This is another powerful
feature that site visitor will get to know more information about the entities.
